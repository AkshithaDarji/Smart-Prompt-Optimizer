# Smart Prompt Optimizer 🎯

This project demonstrates how structured prompting can significantly improve the quality of outputs generated by large language models like ChatGPT (GPT-3.5), using prompt engineering techniques.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Many users of generative AI struggle to get useful outputs due to poorly constructed prompts. This project shows how to improve results using role-based prompting, constraints, and context.

---

## 🧠 Solution
We tested unstructured vs structured prompts on the same task (product description writing) using ChatGPT. Outputs were evaluated based on clarity, specificity, and alignment with the task.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- ChatGPT (GPT-3.5)
- Prompt Engineering Techniques (Role-based, Constraint-driven, Chain-of-Thought)
- No-code approach for testing

---

## 📊 Results
Structured prompts led to more relevant, specific, and engaging responses compared to generic ones.

## 📁 Files
- `Smart_Prompt_Optimizer.pptx`: Final presentation
- `bad_prompt_output.png`, `good_prompt_output.png`: Visual comparisons

---

## 📌 Future Scope
Can be expanded into a prompt recommender tool with support for voice input, multilingual prompts, and domain-specific prompt libraries.
